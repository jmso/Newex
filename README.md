## Idea / Vision
An Asp.Net Web API project that integrates with a .Net project (such as Asp.Net MVC), that is a multilingual CMS.

### Web API Properties
Desirable properties that the project should have are:
- Easy to use, with good API
- Multilingual
- Granular security & authentication
- Ideally only a dll that is referenced, which transforms the .Net project into a CMS.
